# Online Calculator

> Pwn - 200pts

I have made this super cool online calculator so you don't have to use python or the built-in calculator of your operating system.

You can find it and test it out at: \<insert\_ip\_here\>:\<insert\_port\_here\>

PS: it is running over raw TCP, so connect using `nc <ip> <port>`
