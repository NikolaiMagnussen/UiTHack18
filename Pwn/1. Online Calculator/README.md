# Online Calculator

> Pwn - 200pts

I have made this super cool online calculator so you don't have to use python or the built-in calculator of your operating system.

You can find it and test it out at: `46.101.254.102:1337`

PS: it is running over raw TCP, so connect using `nc 46.101.254.102 1337`
