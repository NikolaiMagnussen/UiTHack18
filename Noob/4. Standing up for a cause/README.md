# Standing up for a cause

> Noob 200pts

After earning the rights to call yourself a script kiddie, you will now be tried for the title of [hacktivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism#Notable_hacktivist_groups) at the dojo with the username `uithack_hacktivist`, and the flag from the skid challenge as the password.

As a hacktivist, you should be able to find and unravel information different places on the internet as well as handling important information, potentially encrypted.

Because you are now being considered for the title of hacktivist, I am at liberty to share this piece of encrypted information with you: [paste](https://paste.ee/p/sT8gj), but do not pass it on to untrusted people!

You should be able to locate the encryption key without more of my help!

Hint: you can always use the `/tmp/` directory as a scratchpad, but remember that it might be cleaned up and other hackers might see what you are doing.
