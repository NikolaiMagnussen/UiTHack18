The first task of the Terminal-dojo is to enter it.
After entering the dojo, you find a file named `flag.txt`.

You do so by SSH, with the username `uithack_pleb` and password `let_me_in`.
The Terminal-dojo can be found at the IP address: `139.59.137.9`

If you are new to SSH, it is used as: `ssh <username>@<ip_address>` and then typing the password.

Hint: useful commands might be [ls](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ls) and [cat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cat)
