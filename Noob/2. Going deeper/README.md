# Going deeper

> Noob 100pts

Congratulation on clearing the first level, you now enter deeper, and continue as the `uithack_newb`, with the flag collected in the previous level as password.

This time, the flag will not just be waiting for you, but will be in a hidden file located somewhere in your home directory.

Best of luck!

PS: You don't need to SSH into the new users, because they are located on the same server, you can simply `su <username>` and enter the password.

Hint: [ls](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ls) might have some interesting flags
