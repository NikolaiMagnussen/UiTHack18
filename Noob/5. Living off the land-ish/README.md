# Living off the land-ish

> Noob 250pts

You are now a self-proclaimed hacktivist, let's see if you are made of [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) material!

A useful skill is to [live off the land](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-are-increasingly-living-land), which is the trial you must pass to be recognized as a "certified" hacker.

Living off the land means you should use tools that are already available where you are to minimize the risk of being detected and blocked.

Hint: You might find it helpful to take a look at [Unix permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Changing_permission_behavior_with_setuid,_setgid,_and_sticky_bits) and any binaries in the system that might elevate privileges upon execution. It might also be nice to take a look at [find](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find) to see if you can find some suitable files.
